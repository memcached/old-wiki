Memcached supports two main protocols; the classic ASCII, and the newer binary. It's simpler to write clients and debug problems via the ASCII protocol, but binary affords us many new abilities.

 * [http://github.com/memcached/memcached/blob/master/doc/protocol.txt Text Protocol]
 * [MemcacheBinaryProtocol Binary Protocol]
   * [http://www.slideshare.net/tmaesaka/memcached-binary-protocol-in-a-nutshell-presentation/ Slides on binary protocol ] by Toru Maesaka (2008)

Further, there are sub protocols and proposals

 * [SASLAuthProtocol SASL Authentication]
 * [RangeOps Range operations] - Not to be supported in core, but defined for storage engines and compatible clients.
