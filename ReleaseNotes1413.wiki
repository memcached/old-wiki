== Overview ==

Really tiny release with some important build fixes which were accidentally
omitted from 1.4.12.

For the interesting meat see [ReleaseNotes1412] and [ReleaseNotes1411]
especially, for slab memory reassignment!

== Fixes ==

  * - Fix inline issue with older compilers (gcc 4.2.2)
  * Better detection of sasl_callback_ft

== New Features ==

Sigh.

== Contributors ==

The following people contributed to this release since 1.4.12.

report ended up as a commit with your name on it.

Note that this is just a summary of how many changes each person made
which doesn't necessarily reflect how significant each change was.
For details on what led up into a branch, either grab the git repo and
