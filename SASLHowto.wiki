#summary HOWTO use SASL auth.

= Introduction =

In order to use memcached in a hostile network (e.g. a cloudy ISP where the infrastructure is shared and you can't control it), you're going to want some kind of way to keep people from messing with your cache servers.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer SASL] (as described in [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2222 RFC2222]) is a standard for adding authentication mechanisms to protocols in a way that is protocol independent.

= Getting Started =

In order to deploy memcached with SASL, you'll need two things:

  # A memcached server with SASL support (version 1.4.3 or greater built with `--enable-sasl`)
  # A client that supports SASL

== Configuring SASL ==

For the most part, you just do the normal SASL admin stuff.

{{{
# Create a user for memcached.
saslpasswd2 -a memcached -c cacheuser
}}}

== Running Memcached ==

In order to enable SASL support in the server you must use the `-S` flag.

The `-S` flag does a few things things:

  # Enable all of the SASL commands.
  # Require binary protocol _only_.
  # Require authentication to have been successful before commands may be issued on a connection.
